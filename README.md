# üîÆ Value Prediction with LSTM

This is an academic project focused on developing a predictive model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to forecast corn prices based on time series data. The main goal is to apply artificial intelligence concepts to a real-world forecasting problem.

- **RMSE:** 1.0793  
  (Root Mean Squared Error: measures the square root of the average squared errors)  
- **MAE:** 0.7790  
  (Mean Absolute Error: measures the average absolute errors)

### Predicted vs Actual Values
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38e03994-ef57-4841-a374-995c047f4acf)

- The orange line (predicted values) closely follows the blue line (actual values), with minor fluctuations during the pandemic period.

### Final Comparison
